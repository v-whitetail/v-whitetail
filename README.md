## Hey, I'm @v-whitetail, but my friends call me V! ##

This profile is going to serve as a hub for tools to streamline production for me and my peers.

I primarily work in Architectural Millworks with Fusion 360, so I'm currently focusing on the AddIn ecosystem.

I'm interested in hearing about any approaches to automating CAD!

I've really enjoyed experimenting with OpenSCAD. Programatic and/or fully parametric CAD is exciting!

Feel free to reach out!
